        "Details": "The Stinger was a light BattleMech built in 2479 as a direct competitor to the Wasp. The second-ever mass-produced recon Mech, the Stinger was put into service alongside the Wasp due both to the Terran Hegemonys needs for scouts and to the similarities in their design. In fact the two were so similar that General Mechanics filed suit against Earthwerks for copyright infringement. After twenty years of back-and-forth legal actions, during which Stinger production continued unabated, GM eventually dropped the matter due to the rising costs of pursuing the lawsuit. The Stinger would go on to become the second-most produced Mech in the Inner Sphere after the Wasp.",
